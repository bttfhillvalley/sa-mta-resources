# Back to the Future: Hill Valley resources for MTA San Andreas
This repository contains the resource code of the game mode running on the BTTF:HV MTA Server. It's loosely based on the San Andreas mini mod v0.1.4.3 and implements the features possible with MTA's scripting API.

This game mode makes use of the [RC Mode](https://github.com/MiniMeOSc/mta-rcmode) resource by MiniMeOSc to provide remote controllable DeLoreans.
